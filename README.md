Airdrop Claim Assistant
Your automated assistant for safe and efficient participation in cryptocurrency airdrops and DeFi distributions.

Tired of manually checking dozens of conditions, tracking deadlines, and overpaying for gas fees for futile transactions? Airdrop Claim Assistant is an open-source tool that automates monitoring, eligibility checks, and the process of claiming rewards, saving you time and money.

We simplify the process so you can focus on strategy, not routine.

Key features
Automatic eligibility check: Simply connect your public wallet address. Our assistant will check its activity history, balances, and interactions with smart contracts for compliance with the criteria of hundreds of current airdrop campaigns.

Centralized control panel for all features: All current and upcoming distributions for which you are potentially eligible are collected in one place with clear deadlines, instructions, and verification status.

Smart notifications: Receive notifications (in the app or by email) about new opportunities that are right for you, the end of participation deadlines, and the opening of staking phases.

Return on Investment (ROI) Analysis: The tool analyzes the approximate value of the token and calculates the approximate value of your share, as well as estimates the gas fees required to obtain it, helping you make an informed decision.

Claim Safety Guard: For supported distributions, the assistant provides verified direct links to official claim interfaces and step-by-step instructions to minimize the risk of interacting with phishing sites.

How it works and security
Public data only: Airdrop Claim Assistant works exclusively with information available on the blockchain (public addresses, transactions, smart contract data). It is completely legal and transparent.

Your keys are safe: The program NEVER requests or has access to your private keys, seed phrases, or passwords. All work is done at the level of reading public data.

Local processing of critical data: All analytical calculations related to your addresses are performed locally on your device by default.

Code transparency: As an open-source project, anyone can check its logic and verify that there are no hidden or malicious functions.

Who is this assistant designed for?
Active users of DeFi, NFT, and various blockchain networks who want to ensure they receive their rightful rewards.

Crypto enthusiasts who track multiple projects simultaneously.

Investors who want to automate the search for additional returns from their portfolio.

Beginners who find it difficult to understand the numerous and confusing terms and conditions of various airdrop campaigns.

Important warning about ethical use
Airdrop Claim Assistant is a tool for legal automation.

It is prohibited to use it for mass creation of siblings (multiple accounts) or fraudulent schemes to deceive project verification systems. This violates the rules of most campaigns and harms the community.

The tool does not guarantee income. Secondary market token prices are subject to change. The decision to participate in each giveaway is your personal responsibility.

Always double-check the final steps of the claim on the project's official resources.

Technologies
The project is built on [Python/Node.js/Go – specify your stack] and uses reliable libraries for interacting with blockchains (such as web3.py, ethers.js, axios). We integrate with public RPC nodes and verified APIs to obtain up-to-date data.
